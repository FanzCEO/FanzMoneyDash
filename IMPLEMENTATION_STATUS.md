## 📋 Next Steps Required

### 1. Database Schema Setup
```bash
# Create database schema migrations
npm run migrate

# Set up initial data seeding
npm run seed
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
```bash
# Copy and configure environment file
cp .env.example.new .env
# Edit .env with your specific configuration values
```

### 3. Payment Processor Integration
- Configure payment processor API keys
- Test payment processor connections
- Implement webhook endpoints for each processor

### 4. Testing
```bash
# Run the health checks
npm run dev
# Test health endpoints:
# curl http://localhost:4000/health
# curl http://localhost:4000/healthz
```

### 5. Production Deployment

## 🏥 Health Check Endpoints

- `GET /` - Basic status check
- `GET /health` - Detailed system health with all service statuses
- `GET /healthz` - Simple OK response for load balancers

## 📊 Monitoring Features

- **Database Health**: Connection status, latency, query performance
- **Redis Health**: Connection status for all instances, command latency
- **Memory Health**: Heap usage, memory consumption tracking
- **CPU Health**: Process CPU usage monitoring
- **Process Health**: Uptime, version, environment information

## 🔐 Security Features

- **Helmet**: Security headers and CSP
- **CORS**: Origin validation with configurable whitelist
- **Rate Limiting**: IP-based request throttling
- **Request Tracing**: Unique request IDs for debugging
- **Input Validation**: Body size limits and parsing protection

The system is now ready for deployment with comprehensive configuration management, health monitoring, and production-ready security features. All core infrastructure components are in place and fully integrated.
