## 🔄 Incident Response Procedures

### Incident Classification

#### Severity Levels
- **P1 (Critical)**: Service down, data breach, active attack
- **P2 (High)**: Significant functionality impaired, security compromise
- **P3 (Medium)**: Minor functionality affected, potential security issue
- **P4 (Low)**: Cosmetic issues, minor configuration problems

### Response Timeline

#### P1 Incidents (Critical)
1. **0-2 minutes**: Automated alerting to on-call engineer
2. **2-5 minutes**: Incident commander assigned
3. **5-15 minutes**: Initial assessment and containment
4. **15-30 minutes**: Root cause analysis begins
5. **30-60 minutes**: Resolution or escalation to senior team
